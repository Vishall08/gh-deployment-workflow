# GitHub Actions CI/CD Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages**.

## Project Overview
- Repository contains an `index.html` file.
- Any changes made to `index.html` in the `main` branch trigger an automatic deployment.
- Website is published to GitHub Pages at:
```
https://Vishall08.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/
```


## Workflow
1. Push changes to `main`.
2. If `index.html` is modified, GitHub Actions workflow runs.
3. The workflow builds and deploys the website to GitHub Pages.

## Concepts Learned
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Writing custom GitHub workflows
